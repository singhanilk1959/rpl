This directory contains example code from the book _The Ruby Programming
Language_, by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto and published by
O'Reilly Media. (ISBN 978-0-596-51617-8).

The files with ".rb" extensions are numbered examples from the book.
Example 1-1, for example is in the file 1-1.rb.  That first example is a
complete working Ruby program for solving Sudoku puzzles. Most of the
other numbered examples, however, consist of class and method
definitions and cannot be run as standalone programs.
